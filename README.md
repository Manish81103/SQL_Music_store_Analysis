# Music Store Analysis 

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a music store database using SQL. The database contains multiple tables that store information about the music store's operations, including data on albums, artists, customers, employees, genres, invoices, and more. The purpose of this analysis is to extract valuable insights, generate reports, and answer business-related questions by writing SQL queries.


## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

## 1. Database Tables

__i. Album:__ Stores information about music albums, title and artist ID. Each album has a unique AlbumId and is associated with an artist.

__ii. Artist:__ Contains details about music artists and artist name. Each artist has a unique Artist ID.

__iii. Customer:__ Holds data related to customers, including their name , address , city ,state , email , contact information and the employee who supports them.

__iv. Employee:__ Includes details of the employees working in the music store.details such as name , address , email ,city ,state ,etc.

__v. Genre:__ Contains a list of music genres available in the store.

__vi. Invoice:__ Represents sales transactions. Each invoice has a unique InvoiceId and is linked to a customer.

__vii. InvoiceLine:__ Stores individual items within an invoice. Each line corresponds to a specific track.

__viii. MediaType:__ Lists the types of media (e.g., MP3, AAC) available for the tracks.

__ix. Playlist:__ Contains information about playlists created by customers.

__x.PlaylistTrack:__ Associates tracks with playlists.

__xi. Track:__ Stores data about individual tracks, including the album, genre, and media type.
## 2. Analysis Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are:

i. To identify the top-selling artists and albums.

ii. To analyze customer purchasing patterns.

iii. To determine which genres and media types are most popular.

iv. To assess employee performance based on the invoices they handle.

v. To explore the usage of playlists by customers
## 3. SQL Queries
The analysis is performed using a series of SQL queries , group by functions and joins categorized as follows:

__i.Artist & Album Analysis:__ Queries to find the best-selling artists and most popular albums.

__ii. Customer Analysis:__ Queries to understand customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

__iii. Genre & Media Type Analysis:__ Queries to evaluate the popularity of different music genres and media types.

__iv. Invoice & Sales Analysis:__ Queries to track sales trends and revenue generation.

__v.Employee Performance:__ Queries to measure the sales performance of employees.

__vi. Playlist Analysis:__ Queries to analyze playlist creation and track inclusion
## 4. Results & Insights
After executing the queries, the results will be compiled to provide actionable insights. These insights can help the music store make data-driven decisions, such as which artists to promote, how to segment customers, and how to optimize employee assignments.
## Requirements
i. SQL Database Management System (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.)

ii. Basic understanding of SQL syntax, group by functions , joins and database management

iii. Access to the music store database schema and data.

## How to Run the Project
__1. Database Setup:__ Ensure that the music store database is properly set up in your SQL environment. Import the database schema and data if necessary.

__2. SQL Execution:__ Use any SQL query tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio) to run the SQL queries provided in this project.

__3. Review Results:__ Analyze the output of the queries to derive insights. The results can be exported to CSV files for further analysis if needed.
## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a music store's operations by leveraging SQL queries. By exploring various aspects of the store's data, it helps to uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities for improvement in the business
